## Labels ##

To translate the labels fill in the labels with texts in your language, or just with different texts. The following texts can be translated:

| **Label** | **Default** |
|:----------|:------------|
| photo     | photo       |
| photos    | photos      |
| downloadphotos | Download photos |
| albums    | Back to albums |
| noalbums  | No albums available |
| page      | Page        |
| prev      | Previous    |
| next      | Next        |
| showPermaLink | Show PermaLink |
| showMap   | Show Map    |
| videoNotSupported | Video not supported |

See [Example](#Example.md) below on how to add these to your configuration.

## Months ##

To translate the monthnames fill in the names with the names in your language.

## Query parameters ##

Query parameters are used to pass information to a web page using the URL. This is the information usually after a question mark. PWI supports the following query parameters:

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:----------------|
| pwi\_album\_selected | Album to be selected. Changes mode to album. |
| pwi\_albumpage | Page within an album to show. Should be less than the number of pages in an album. Note that when the setting maxResults is changed this value should also be changed. |
| pwi\_showpermalink | Overrules the showPermaLink setting, showing the perma-link box at the bottom of the page. Can be used to request a perma-link of a page without modifying the settings |

An example of a URL containg these query parameters:

http://pwi.googlecode.com/svn/tags/REL_2_0_0/demo9.html?pwi_album_selected=DanceParade2008&pwi_albumpage=4

Note that the permalink feature will be switched off when a specific page is selected using this feature.

## Example ##

Below is an example on how to change certain settings and labels of PWI. Make sure you end each setting with a comma except for the last one.

```
$(document).ready(function() {

	var options = {
		username: 'YourPicasaUserName',
		mode: 'albums',
		albums: ["Album1","Album2"],
		labels: {photo:"picture",
		         photos: "pictures"
		        },
        months: ["JANUARY", "FEBRUARY", "MARCH", "APRIL", "MAY", "JUNE", "JULY", "AUGUST", "SEPTEMBER", "OCTOBER", "NOVEMBER", "DECEMBER"],
	};

	$("#container").pwi(options);

});
   
```

This example will show the albums page with thumbnails of Album1 and Album2 of Picasa user YourPicasaUserName. Instead of the label "photo" the label "picture" will be used. All month names will be in capitals.
