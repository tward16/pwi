#summary Showing maps

# Introduction #

In Picasa photos can contain geographical information. This indicates where the photo was taken. In PWI it is possible to show this information on a map for each photo, but it is also possible to show a map containing all location in one folder.

This feature uses Google Maps to display the locations.

  * On the Picasa web interface (http://picasaweb.google.com) go to the album where you want to show maps.
